# BCC ZoneNotify Script for RedM

This script allows players to receive notifications about specific zones in RedM, and optionally, draw sprites on the screen based on zone data.

## Features

- **Zone Notifications**: Displays notifications when players enter specific zones, showing details like district, town, state, and time.
- **Sprite Drawing**: Draws sprites on the screen based on zone data (e.g., texture dictionaries and sprite names).
- **Dynamic Zone Information**: Supports dynamic data for zones, including time, temperature, district, state, and more.
- **Customizable Sprite Drawing**: The script allows for sprite drawing based on zone data and configuration.
- **Visibility Control**: Notifications are shown for a fixed duration (default is 4 seconds) and automatically hidden after that time.
